EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is a critical component of any data science or machine learning project. It is the process of analysing, visualising, and comprehending a dataset in order to extract useful insights and patterns. EDA helps identify important features and relationships among variables, which aids in the development of a better predictive model. In this section, we will cover the various EDA techniques and how they are implemented in Python.
